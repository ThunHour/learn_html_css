            <p>Battambang (Khmer: ក្រុងបាត់ដំបង) is the capital of Battambang province in Northwestern Cambodia. Founded in the 11th century by the Khmer Empire, Battambang is the leading rice-producing province of the country. For nearly 100 years it was a major commercial hub and provincial capital of Siamese province of Inner Cambodia (1795-1907), though it was always populated by Khmer, with some ethnic Vietnamese, Lao, Thai and Chinese. Battambang remains the hub of Cambodia's northwest, connecting the region with Phnom Penh and Thailand.</p></div>

                        All the ingredients are mixed together and put in banana leaf cups with coconut cream on top, then steamed. Another common form is amok chouk – snails with curry steamed in their shells. It's best served with a plate of hot, steamed rice.

        <h2>While it’s a city of 250,000 people, it’s still got that small town charm that entices you to rent a bicycle or a moto and just explore. Pack a backpack for the day and go on a excursion to discover side-of-the-road food stands, wander bright green rice fields, explore old country dirt roads, venture over to some ancient temples and then pop into a coffee shop for an artisan latte. Life here is slow and laid back- as most places worth seeing usually are.
